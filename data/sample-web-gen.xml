    <!-- We could include this from a separate XML file but
         it's easy enough to configure here.
         This is the "grammar" used to parse the log file as we
         go.  Currently, the generator will call the find() method
         to parse it which operates like Java's regex Pattern.find()
         and will therefore skip parts of the input that it doesn't
         understand.  This is easier than trying to define a fully
         inclusive grammar or having to build .* in directly. -->
