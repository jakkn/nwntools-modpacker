|        |        |             1.  For the Targa 24, it should be 0.  For     |

|        |        |  required, it can be stored after the image data.          |

|        |        |  This field specifies (width) x (height) pixels.  Each     |
|        |        |  pixel specifies an RGB color value, which is stored as    |
|        |        |  an integral number of bytes.                              |

|        |        |  The 2 byte entry is broken down as follows:               |
|        |        |  ARRRRRGG GGGBBBBB, where each letter represents a bit.    |
|        |        |  But, because of the lo-hi storage order, the first byte   |
|        |        |  coming from the file will actually be GGGBBBBB, and the   |
|        |        |  second will be ARRRRRGG. "A" represents an attribute bit. |
|        |        |                                                            |
|        |        |  The 3 byte entry contains 1 byte each of blue, green,     |

|        |        |  The 4 byte entry contains 1 byte each of blue, green,     |
|        |        |  red, and attribute.  For faster speed (because of the     |
|        |        |  hardware of the Targa board itself), Targa 24 images are  |
|        |        |  sometimes stored as Targa 32 images.                      |
